# Forgejo reconciliation

The engine does **not** detect missed webhooks directly. It
**reconciles** periodically against Forgejo and re-derives from the
source of truth (eventual consistency): a missed event shows up as a
stale watermark relative to Forgejo's current state, and the sweep
dispatches the delta. The sweep also catches issues and pull requests
created while the engine was down.

## The sweep

`Reconcile()` on the engine:

1. **Enumerate the repositories.** List the org's repositories
   (§forgejo/config/canned-prompts names the org) and keep those whose
   topics include `maitred-enabled`.
2. **Enumerate the objects.** For each such repository, list **all**
   open issues and all open pull requests
   (§forgejo/client/operations). The issue list includes pull requests
   (Forgejo represents them as issues); the sweep skips the ones marked
   as pull requests — the pull request list covers them.
3. **Decide and dispatch.** For each listed object, feed the synthetic
   `reconcile` event (§forgejo/decisions/inputs) through the **same
   pipeline as the event path** (§forgejo/webhook/the-pipeline):
   re-fetch, decide, dispatch, watermark — serialised on the watermark
   store's per-key lock (§forgejo/state/concurrency). The sweep shares
   the decision function and the event path; no logic is duplicated.

The synthetic event carries no sender.

## Scheduling

The sweep runs once when the engine starts, then on a **configurable
interval** — the `reconcile_interval` config value
(§forgejo/config/canned-prompts), positive, validated at load time.
Overlapping sweeps do not run concurrently: a sweep that starts while
another is in flight is skipped.

## Failure handling

A failure enumerating the org's repositories ends the sweep (it is
logged). A failure listing one repository's issues or pull requests is
logged, and the sweep continues with the repository's remaining list and
the remaining repositories. Per-object failures follow the event path's
hold-off semantics (§forgejo/webhook/the-pipeline). A sweep never
aborts the engine.

## Idempotency

Because the sweep feeds the same decision function the same watermark,
an already-dispatched `(action, revision)` is not re-dispatched
(§forgejo/decisions/loop-prevention). The sweep is safe to run at any
time, and re-running it is a no-op until Forgejo's state or the
watermarks move.
